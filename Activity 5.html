<h2><b>Details About PWDs</b></h2>

<ul type="square">
	<li><em>Persons with disabilities (PWDs), according the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities </em></li>
	<li><em>Globally, over 1 billion people, or approximately 15% of the world’s population, have some form of disability. About 110 to 190 million people 15 years and older have significant difficulties in functioning. </em></li>
	<li><em>PWD was based on Republic Act No. 7277, “An Act Providing for the Rehabilitation and Self-Reliance of Disabled Persons and Their Integration into the Mainstream of Society and for Other Purposes”</em></li>
	<li><em>in the Philippines, the results of the 2010 Census of Population and Housing (CPH, 2010) show that of the household population of 92.1 million, 1.443 million Filipinos or 1.57%, have a disability. </em></li>
</ul>

	<li><em>Removal of barriers and improve access to health services and programs. People with disabilities, including children, encounter a range of attitudinal, physical and systemic barriers when they attempt to access
			health care such as physical barriers related to the architectural design of health facilities or health providers’ lack of adequate knowledge and skills in providing services for persons with disabilities, among many others.</em></li>
	<li><em>Strengthening and expansion of rehabilitation, habilitation, assistive technology, and community based rehabilitation.  Habilitation and rehabilitation are “sets of measures that assist individuals, who experienceor are
			likely to experience disability, to achieve and maintain optimal functioning, in interaction with their environments”. Encompassing medical care, therapy and assistive technologies, they should begin as early as possible and be
			made available as close as possible to where people with disabilities live.</em></li>
	<li><em>Strengthening collection of relevant and internationally comparable disability data and support disability researches. Data is needed to strengthen health care systems, as it informs policy and interventions.  These can be
			collected through dedicated disability surveys, or disaggregating data from other data collection efforts by disability status, and research.</em></li>
	<li><em>Interventions along this action area should ensure that data collected would be internationally comparable and results of researches and studies done are used for informing policy and resource allocation. The use of the
			Philippine Registry for Persons with Disability is an intervention that should be strengthened and made fully operational.</em></li>
	<li><em>Increasing government investments in habilitation, rehabilitation and provision of assistive technologies are expected actions or interventions that must be put in place.  This is going to  be beneficial in the long run because
			they build human capacity and can be instrumental in enabling people with limitations in functioning to remain in or return to their home or community, live independently, and participate in all aspects of life. They can reduce the need
			for formal support services as well as reduce the time and physical burden for caregivers.</em></li>
	<li><em>ctions or interventions should be under taken to ensure that persons with disabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to health facilities and services. It is important to identify all of these barriers and institute 		
			collective actions to remove these barriers and improve access of persons with disabilities to health services and programs.</em></li>
